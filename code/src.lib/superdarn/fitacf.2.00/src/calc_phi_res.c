  changed the return type of this function from void to int
  the function now checks to see if all the phases turned out
  to be 0.  If so, it returns -1, otherwise it returns 0.

  The return code of -1 indicates that you can't really do a fit
  because all the phases were exactly 0.  This can happen when
  the power is low and we are reprocessing DAT files that have lost
  some precision.
